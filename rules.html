    <h2>Cards and their values</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The cards that have a number on them have the same value as the number(e.g 2=2, 8=8 etc.).</li>
        <li><b>J</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>K</b> share the same value: 10</li>
        <li><b>A</b> can have the value 1 or 11, depending on the other cards you have(e.g if you have a 2, <b>A</b> has the value 11, if you have a 10 and 2, <b>A</b> is 1).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The game is played with multiple sets of cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dealer and the player(s) both start with 2 cards. One of the dealers' cards is not shown to the player(s).<br />
        The goal is to be as close to 21 as possible without going above it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dealer has to get another card if the value of their cards does not reach 17.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a player goes above 21, they automatically lose whether the dealer goes above 21 or not.</li>
            <li>If a player has 2 cards and their value is 21 (10+11), they automatically win. The same applies to the dealer.</li>
            <li>If the player and the dealer share the same value of cards, it's a draw.</li>
            <li>If a player has 5 cards and doesn't go above 21, they automatically win. Same applies to the dealer.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
